/* What's the point of this?  None other than to practice. Theres a lot of loops so the user can go back and forth in the program.
*
*    Couple of things to note:
*    1. If it asks you to enter 1, 2, or 3 for an option, don't enter a string or it will loop forever.
*    2. If it asks you to enter a string for an option, don't enter a number or it will loop forever.
*
*   *TO DO:*
*    - Make exit function work correctly (Doesn't work in some areas).
*    - Make code neater.
*    - Improve the spacing between cout statements in program.
