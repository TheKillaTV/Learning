This will be an all in one program for multiple games. These games include: Rock Paper Sissors, Connect4, Hangman, TicTacToe, 
and others. 

The user will be able to move around in between games and after every time the user leaves the game, they'll have the
option to save their stats to a file. 

Even though I have already done these, I am re-doing them from scratch because they can be improved and I want to practice more
with classes.

Stat saving will be saved for last.
